  "dailyBrief": "December 17th saw a surge in high-impact cyber events, including critical exploits targeting both corporate networks and major DeFi platforms.

Financial losses were significant, with Ribbon Finance suffering a $2.7 million breach and Yearn Finance losing $300,000 in a sophisticated flash loan exploit. Malware campaigns and leaks, such as Phantom 3.5 and Devman RaaS, highlight ongoing risks from fraud and poor operational security. Overall, the day demonstrates aggressive threat actor tactics, rapid exploitation of new vulnerabilities, and sustained financial targeting—requiring vigilant patching, incident response, and monitoring."
