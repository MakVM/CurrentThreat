  "dailyBrief": "Today saw a significant escalation in cyber threats, with multiple high-impact incidents reported. Critical vulnerabilities in Fortinet products and React software are actively being exploited, affecting both enterprise infrastructure and thousands of websites. Two major breaches—at 700Credit and the French Ministry of the Interior—resulted in the exposure of millions of personal records. Additionally, a persistent scam involving fiat transactions continues to circulate. The convergence of exploits, data breaches, and large-scale attacks indicates an elevated threat landscape requiring urgent defensive measures."
