  "dailyBrief": "Today saw a surge in high-severity cyber threats, with multiple major breaches and hacks impacting the financial sector, national infrastructure, and blockchain ecosystems. Notable events include a third-party data breach at JPMorgan Chase, a mass data leak affecting French citizens, and an ongoing attack on Polygon smart contracts. A staggering $282M crypto theft via social engineering highlights the rise in sophisticated scams. The discovery of a large China-based malware C2 network and the hijacking of Milwaukee Airport's social media further heighten the day's risk profile. Organizations are advised to review incident response protocols and strengthen defenses against targeted scams, social engineering, and supply chain vulnerabilities."
