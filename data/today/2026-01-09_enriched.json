  "overallDayThreatScore": 92,
  "dailyBrief": "Today's cyber landscape saw a series of high-impact attacks and exploits, including major breaches by nation-state actors and criminal groups targeting telecom, AI platforms, and financial assets. Notably, China-linked groups compromised Southeastern Europe telecom providers using advanced Linux malware, while the Salt Typhoon espionage campaign underscores persistent state-driven threats. Cryptocurrency platforms were hit hard, with Truebit losing $26M to an exploit and GoBruteforcer targeting blockchain projects. Widespread vulnerabilities in popular products (Cisco ISE, HPE OneView, ChatGPT) were actively exploited, while large-scale data leaks affected millions of users, particularly in the AI and retail sectors. The overall threat level is critically high, with coordinated attacks, sophisticated exploits, and significant financial and information losses reported."
