  "dailyBrief": "Today's cyber landscape saw a surge in high-severity events, including major breaches at Dell Technologies and Betterment, a confirmed leak of Target's source code, and a $26M exploit of Truebit's smart contract. Multiple incidents involved direct customer impact and financial loss, particularly in fintech and crypto platforms. Notable trends include repeated exploitation of authentication systems, targeting of internal data repositories, and sophisticated smart contract vulnerabilities. Organizations should prioritize internal code repository security, strengthen authentication mechanisms, and monitor for emerging exploit patterns."
