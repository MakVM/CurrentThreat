  "dailyBrief": "The day saw a significant rise in both data breaches and sophisticated scams. High-severity events include a crypto scam where attackers impersonate police to steal millions, and a major data leak impacting nearly 10,000 Washington Post employees and contractors due to an Oracle-related attack. Multiple organizations, including FUCASA, PACCAR, and Cinvestav, were targeted and claimed breached by active hacking groups. The trending threats reflect targeted attacks on large entities and evolving fraud tactics, indicating an elevated level of risk and the need for heightened vigilance."
