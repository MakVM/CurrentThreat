  "dailyBrief": "Today's cyber threat environment is elevated, with multiple high-severity incidents. A major phone number exposure and a verified exploit affecting municipal police records highlight significant data leaks and privacy risks. Additional events include a reported data breach at AT&T and active zero-day exploitation targeting Fortinet systems. The prevalence of exploits, leaks, and breaches, especially involving critical infrastructure and personal data, underscores the need for heightened vigilance and rapid response."
