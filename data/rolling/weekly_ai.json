  "weeklyBrief": "During the week of November 14–20, 2025, the cyber threat landscape was marked by a series of high-impact incidents affecting both organizations and individuals. Major data breaches targeted prominent entities including the Washington Post, DoorDash, Logitech, Eurofiber France, and AT&T, often exploiting vulnerabilities or leveraging social engineering tactics. Cryptocurrency platforms and AI trading systems faced substantial thefts and private key leaks, while scams and frauds—such as police impersonation, ReportCyber exploitation, and Telegram scam groups—continued to proliferate globally. Notably, the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Oracle E-Business Suite and Chrome underscored the persistent risks associated with unpatched systems. Widespread fraud, as seen in the SNAP program, and persistent attacks on financial technology platforms further highlighted the need for enhanced vigilance and rapid response.",
  "trends": "Analysis of the week's events reveals several key trends: a sustained high volume of data breaches and hacks targeting large organizations and critical infrastructure; a notable rise in sophisticated scams and frauds leveraging social engineering and trusted channels; increased exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in widely used platforms; and ongoing threats to cryptocurrency assets and fintech services. There is also an uptick in incidents involving third-party service providers, highlighting supply chain risks. The severity scores remained elevated throughout the week, with multiple days registering scores above 80, indicating a persistently high-risk environment.",
  "predictions": "In the coming days, expect continued targeting of major enterprises, especially those utilizing popular software platforms like Chrome and Oracle E-Business Suite, as attackers attempt to capitalize on recently disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities. Scams exploiting social engineering techniques and trusted platforms are likely to persist, with financial and personal data remaining prime targets. Organizations should be prepared for further attacks on supply chain and third-party services. The threat environment will remain active, with high likelihood of additional breaches and fraud incidents, particularly in the financial and technology sectors. Confidence in these predictions is high, given the consistent escalation and diversity of attack vectors observed over the past week."
