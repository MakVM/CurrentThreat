  "weeklyBrief": "The week of November 14–20, 2025, was marked by a surge in high-severity cyber incidents affecting both public and private sectors globally. High-profile data breaches impacted major organizations such as DoorDash, Logitech, and Eurofiber France, while coordinated scams exploited trusted platforms including ReportCyber and Telegram. Attackers leveraged social engineering, exploited zero-day vulnerabilities (notably in Chrome and Oracle E-Business Suite), and targeted both financial technologies and government infrastructure. Several incidents resulted in substantial data exposure, including sensitive personal information, municipal records, and private keys tied to AI trading systems. This period underscores the escalating sophistication and diversity of cyber threats, as well as the persistent risk to critical infrastructure and end users.",
  "trends": "Key trends this week include a conspicuous rise in zero-day exploitations (Chrome, Oracle E-Business Suite), repeated successful data breaches at large organizations, and increased criminal focus on financial and government systems. Social engineering remains a prevalent attack vector, with both individual scams and large-scale fraud (e.g., SNAP reapplication scam, DoorDash employee compromise). There was a notable spike in crypto-related theft and fraud, especially targeting AI-powered platforms. Data leaks involving phone numbers and municipal records indicate a broadening scope of targets. The overall threat scores remained consistently high, with little sign of abatement in attack frequency or severity.",
  "predictions": "Looking ahead to the next seven days, expect continued high-risk activity focused on exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, particularly as attackers capitalize on slow patch cycles and user inertia. Financial platforms, especially those involving cryptocurrency and AI, will likely remain primary targets for both technical exploits and social engineering scams. Data breaches affecting large organizations and government entities are expected to persist, with potential spillover from ongoing incidents. Categories to monitor closely include browser and enterprise software vulnerabilities, crypto platforms, and public sector data stores. Confidence in these predictions is high given the recent escalation and persistence of these threat vectors, and ongoing global instability may further fuel cybercriminal operations."
