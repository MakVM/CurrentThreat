  "weeklyBrief": "This week saw elevated cyber risk, particularly in the financial, cryptocurrency, and technology sectors. High-impact incidents included major breaches at Bank Mandiri and the French Football Federation, multiple hacks against Upbit and Yearn Finance, and a significant supply chain attack via malicious software and compromised NPM packages. The crypto space was especially volatile, with over $127M lost to hacks and scams in November and several notable exploits draining millions more. Supply chain vulnerabilities, credential theft, and sophisticated social engineering attacks were prominent, signaling a persistent and evolving threat landscape. Executive attention should focus on rapid incident response, robust security controls, and user awareness initiatives.",
  "trends": "Financial institutions and crypto platforms remain top targets, with repeated breaches and exploits driving high-severity threat scores throughout the week. Notably, Upbit endured multiple hacks and wallet vulnerabilities, while Yearn Finance suffered consecutive exploits. The emergence of supply chain attacks—such as the Babylon RAT-infected utility and NPM registry infections—indicates increasing risk in trusted software channels. Social engineering scams, including fake interviews and direct scam alerts, continue to target both organizations and individuals. There is a clear pattern of attackers seeking large financial gains and exploiting technical weaknesses in DeFi and fintech environments.",
  "predictions": "Expect continued targeting of cryptocurrency and financial platforms, with a high likelihood of further exploits and scams. Software supply chain attacks may increase, especially via popular utilities and developer repositories. Social engineering campaigns are likely to persist, exploiting trust and targeting high-profile individuals and institutions. DeFi protocols and exchanges should brace for technical exploits and wallet vulnerabilities, with threat actors adapting tactics as security teams patch previous flaws. Confidence in these predictions is high, given the consistency of attack patterns and recent global news highlighting regulatory scrutiny and ongoing cybercrime activity in these sectors."
