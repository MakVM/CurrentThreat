  "weeklyBrief": "Over the past week, the cyber threat landscape has been marked by a surge in high-severity incidents targeting cryptocurrency platforms, financial institutions, and personal data repositories. Notable events include a series of ongoing attacks against EVM-compatible wallets, major data breaches (such as the ENSAI student leak and OfferteCartucce breach), and sophisticated phishing and malware campaigns exploiting both new and old vulnerabilities. Crypto wallet exploits and phishing related to MetaMask and Trust Wallet have led to substantial financial losses, while ransomware and botnet activity continue to threaten tech infrastructure globally. The persistent targeting of healthcare, retail, and tech sectors, as well as the exploitation of previously compromised data (e.g., LastPass), underscores the evolving tactics and growing scale of cybercriminal operations. Organizations and individuals are urged to prioritize vigilance, timely patching, and robust incident response.",
  "trends": "Multiple incidents point to a sustained spike in attacks against crypto wallets and exchanges, with wallet-draining exploits recurring almost daily. Phishing campaigns have become more sophisticated, leveraging realistic 2FA flows and themed emails (such as the New Year MetaMask scam). Data leaks and breaches remain high, with several large-scale exposures reported, affecting both businesses and individuals. Botnets and malware campaigns, notably the RondoDox exploits targeting Next.js servers and Android banking malware, highlight a trend toward infrastructure and supply chain compromise. There is a rising pattern of attacks exploiting both new vulnerabilities (React2Shell, AWS key flaws) and historic breaches (LastPass), suggesting attackers are leveraging a diverse set of entry points. Declines are not evident; the threat level remains consistently elevated throughout the week.",
  "predictions": "In the coming days, expect continued, high-confidence risks to crypto wallets and exchanges, with wallet-draining exploits and phishing campaigns likely to persist and potentially escalate. Financial and personal data leaks will remain a critical concern, particularly for organizations in finance, retail, and healthcare. The sophistication of phishing techniques—including advanced 2FA scams and themed lures—will likely increase, targeting both end-users and customer support channels. Infrastructure attacks leveraging emerging vulnerabilities (such as React2Shell and supply chain flaws) may see further exploitation, especially as attackers pivot tactics post-holiday. Ongoing monitoring of DeFi platforms, browser extensions, and cloud environments is highly recommended. Confidence level: high for continued wallet/phishing risks; medium for major infrastructure or supply chain exploits; and high for persistent data breach attempts."
