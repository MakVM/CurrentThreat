  "weeklyBrief": "The week was marked by a series of high-severity cyber incidents spanning cryptocurrency, finance, e-commerce, and critical infrastructure. Notable events included major exploits draining EVM chain wallets and phishing attacks leveraging MetaMask, as well as data breaches impacting Trust Wallet, OfferteCartucce, ENSAI, and Farmacia San Pablo. The emergence of advanced attack automation tools (ErrTraffic), multi-vector botnet campaigns targeting Next.js servers, and persistent malware against global banks underscored the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Organizations in crypto, healthcare, and technology sectors faced elevated risk, with attackers exploiting software vulnerabilities, supply chain weaknesses, and social engineering tactics. The overall environment is one of heightened alert, with threat actors showing increased sophistication and persistence.",
  "trends": "Several converging trends dominated the week: 1) Intensified wallet-draining attacks across EVM blockchains, often involving phishing and exploits on major platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet; 2) Frequent and large-scale data breaches targeting both public-facing companies (e.g., OfferteCartucce, ENSAI, Farmacia San Pablo) and internal systems; 3) Growth of credential theft and phishing campaigns, including those leveraging npm packages and targeting specific geographies such as India; 4) Increased targeting of financial institutions, both traditional (banking malware) and crypto-related, with persistent threat actors reusing historical breach data (LastPass). Automation and modular tools are enabling more scalable, diverse, and persistent attacks, while ransomware and botnet operations are exploiting newly disclosed vulnerabilities. Notably, threat scores peaked midweek, suggesting a post-holiday surge in malicious activity.",
  "predictions": "In the coming days, expect continued high risk for crypto wallet holders, especially on EVM-compatible chains, as wallet-draining, phishing, and exploit campaigns persist. Data breaches and credential leaks are likely to remain frequent, with e-commerce, healthcare, and financial sectors especially vulnerable. Botnet and ransomware activity will probably escalate, targeting new software vulnerabilities (such as React2Shell and Next.js) and supply chains. Phishing and credential theft will expand geographically, with increased sophistication in lure tactics. Given the ongoing verification and investigation phases in current incidents (e.g., Farmacia San Pablo, OKX wallet), more details and possibly additional victims may emerge. Confidence level: High for continued wallet and data compromise, Moderate for escalation of botnet and ransomware campaigns. Organizations should maintain elevated vigilance, update incident response plans, and closely monitor threat intelligence feeds."
