      "dailyBrief": "December 23, 2025 saw a surge in high-severity cyber threats, including several malware campaigns targeting popular platforms, major data breaches, and critical software vulnerabilities actively exploited for ransomware. Notably, the Stealka and WebRAT malware attacks leveraged trusted sites to infect users, while Baker University’s breach affected tens of thousands. The US Justice Department’s takedown of a $14.6 million fraud operation highlights continued large-scale credential theft. Organizations should prioritize patching, threat intelligence, and phishing awareness as attackers increasingly exploit both technical and social vectors."
