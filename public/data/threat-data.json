    "briefing": "This week saw a marked escalation in cyber threat activity across multiple sectors, with major breaches, advanced exploits, and sophisticated social engineering campaigns. High-impact incidents included ransomware and VPN-related breaches at financial institutions, a substantial data leak affecting automakers, and the dismantling of a €700M deepfake-powered crypto scam network. Exploits targeting AI platforms (GeminiJack), zero-click spyware attacks (Intellexa Predator), and widespread infostealer campaigns demonstrated the increasing complexity and reach of threat actors. Social platforms like Telegram and WeChat were repeatedly leveraged for scams and fraud, targeting users in crypto and fintech communities. The convergence of high-severity breaches, advanced malware, and AI-related vulnerabilities highlights the urgent need for cross-sector vigilance and rapid response capabilities.",
    "trends": "The week exhibited elevated threat scores on most days, correlating with peaks in ransomware, data breaches, and advanced exploit reports. Financial services and healthcare sectors were notably targeted, with persistent attacks exploiting VPN and software vulnerabilities. There was a visible uptick in AI-related threats, especially zero-click exploits and critical flaws in popular platforms, alongside a surge in deepfake-driven scams. Social engineering, fraud, and malware attacks via messaging platforms (Telegram, WeChat) remained consistent, with scammers adapting tactics to leverage altered profiles and vector attacks. Periods of relative calm (Dec 6, 8) were followed by concentrated spikes, indicating episodic but high-intensity activity.",
    "predictions": "Expect continued targeting of financial, healthcare, and large enterprise sectors, with ransomware, third-party vendor exploits, and mass data exfiltration attempts likely to persist. AI platforms and services are at heightened risk for zero-click vulnerabilities and data leakage, especially as threat actors refine attack vectors involving poisoned files and malicious ads. Deepfake and social engineering scams will remain prevalent across crypto and fintech communities, with scammers leveraging messaging platforms and impersonation tactics. Malware campaigns targeting mobile and macOS users are expected to intensify, particularly via deceptive ads and chatbots. Confidence level: High for persistence of breaches, scams, and AI-related exploits; Medium for emergence of new ransomware strains or large-scale third-party vendor compromises."
