    "briefing": "This week was marked by an exceptionally high volume of severe cyber incidents targeting financial institutions, academic organizations, and critical infrastructure worldwide. Notable breaches included the compromise of SitusAMC affecting major global banks, a large-scale attack on Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and significant hacks at Upbit resulting in multimillion-dollar losses. Academic institutions like Harvard and Dartmouth faced data breaches and phishing attacks, while widespread scams, leaks, and exploits—including a Microsoft Teams vulnerability and multi-year critical infrastructure data exposures—demonstrated the increasingly diversified threat landscape. The frequency, scale, and cross-sector nature of these events suggest a heightened risk environment, with organized threat actors aggressively targeting digital assets and supply chains.",
    "trends": "A clear trend this week was the surge in high-impact breaches and hacks, particularly in the financial and cryptocurrency sectors, with repeated incidents at Upbit and data exposures at major banks. Academic institutions also emerged as attractive targets, suffering both extortion and phishing-based compromises. Scam activity remained persistent across social media and crypto platforms, impacting individual users through P2P trade fraud and phishing. Infrastructure and government-related data leaks were notable, indicating ongoing systemic vulnerabilities. Importantly, the average daily threat score peaked mid-to-late week (90–92), reflecting concentrated attacker activity, while the last day showed a temporary lull—likely cyclical rather than indicative of reduced risk.",
    "predictions": "Looking ahead, expect continued pressure on financial services, fintech, and crypto platforms—especially as attackers exploit supply chain relationships and wallet vulnerabilities. High-profile institutions should anticipate further attempted breaches and extortion, while users remain at elevated risk for scams and phishing. The discovery of flaws in mainstream collaboration tools (e.g. Microsoft Teams) points to likely increases in malware campaigns targeting remote work infrastructure. Data leaks and fraud will remain persistent threats, especially as threat actors leverage stolen credentials and personal data from recent incidents. Confidence level: High. Organizations should prioritize incident response readiness, strengthen authentication mechanisms, and intensify monitoring for lateral movement and social engineering attempts."
