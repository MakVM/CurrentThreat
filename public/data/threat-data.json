    "briefing": "The week ending December 29, 2025, was marked by an unprecedented wave of high-impact cyber incidents spanning financial, educational, media, and cryptocurrency sectors. Major breaches and leaks affected millions, including the University of Phoenix, Baker University, Condé Nast/Wired, and multiple banks, amplifying concerns about data privacy and third-party vulnerabilities. The cryptocurrency ecosystem was hit especially hard, with losses exceeding $3.35 billion for the year, fueled by sophisticated malware (RatOn, Stealka, SantaStealer), supply chain attacks (Trust Wallet extension), and large-scale scams. Critical vulnerabilities were actively exploited, and ransomware operations continued to target institutions worldwide. The scale, velocity, and diversity of attacks signal an elevated, complex threat landscape, demanding rigorous attention to supply chain, authentication, and endpoint security.",
    "trends": "Key trends include a notable surge in breaches linked to third-party vendors and supply chain attacks, exemplified by the Trust Wallet Chrome extension compromise and bank breaches. Data leaks are increasingly targeting large media outlets and financial institutions, with attackers exfiltrating and publicly distributing millions of personal records. Cryptocurrency platforms and users remain top targets, facing persistent malware campaigns, scams, and exploits—often spread via popular sites and browser extensions. There is ongoing exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities and a shift towards multi-vector attacks leveraging social engineering, phishing, and technical flaws. Law enforcement disruption of fraud infrastructure is notable but does not significantly slow down adversary activity. Overall, attackers are pursuing high-value data and assets through increasingly stealthy and scalable methods.",
    "predictions": "In the coming days, expect continued high risk for organizations relying on third-party platforms and browser extensions, especially in the crypto and financial sectors. New malware variants and supply chain attacks are likely, with threat actors targeting software updates and authentication mechanisms. Data leaks involving large user bases—media, banks, and SaaS platforms—may spike further, as adversaries leverage stolen information for secondary campaigns. Ransomware and infostealer activity will remain elevated, with increased use of phishing and social engineering around the holiday/New Year period. Confidence is high (80-90%) that high-severity incidents will persist, and organizations should prioritize patching, vendor risk management, user awareness, and rapid response capabilities. Watch for heightened regulatory and law enforcement actions, but expect attackers to adapt quickly."
