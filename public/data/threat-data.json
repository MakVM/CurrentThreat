    "briefing": "This week witnessed an intense escalation in cyber threats, spanning large-scale financial thefts, data breaches affecting millions, and high-impact exploits targeting the crypto and DeFi sectors. The Trust Wallet extension compromise was a recurring theme, resulting in user losses exceeding $7 million and exposing persistent supply chain risks. Major organizations such as banks, Condé Nast, Atalian, and Omrania suffered substantial data and financial losses, while threat actors actively leveraged new attack automation tools and sophisticated phishing campaigns. The emergence of advanced threat vectors—ransomware, credential theft, and automated exploit kits—underscores a rapidly evolving landscape where both institutional and individual targets face increasingly complex and damaging attacks.",
    "trends": "Key patterns include a spike in supply chain and third-party vendor breaches, especially impacting financial institutions, media companies, and crypto platforms. Data leaks and ransomware incidents surged, with attackers demonstrating a preference for large-scale exfiltration (hundreds of GBs, millions of records) and credential theft. Phishing campaigns using npm packages and modular RATs targeted industrial, healthcare, and regional sectors (notably India). DeFi platforms experienced notable governance and multisig failures, leading to drained funds and halted operations. A new wave of attack automation (ErrTraffic) and persistent compensation efforts by affected organizations reflect both threat actor innovation and defensive adaptation. Overall, the week saw elevated threat scores, with multiple consecutive days above 80, indicating sustained high risk.",
    "predictions": "Expect continued targeting of browser extensions, DeFi platforms, and third-party vendors, with attackers likely to leverage supply chain weaknesses and automation tools. Data leaks—especially involving personal and financial information—will remain frequent, with ransomware actors focusing on service providers and critical infrastructure. Watch for expansion of phishing operations into new regions and sectors, plus further exploits in the crypto space as compensation mechanisms are stress-tested. The emergence of new cybercrime kits suggests a growing threat to web-facing assets and credential stores. Confidence level: high, based on consistent patterns, elevated threat scores, and global news indicating increased cybercriminal activity during the holiday period. Organizations should prioritize third-party risk management, rapid incident response, and proactive user protection."
