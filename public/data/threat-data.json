  "past7Days": {
    "briefing": "This week has been marked by a surge in high-impact cyber incidents spanning critical sectors such as cryptocurrency, education, finance, media, and gaming. Notable events include major data breaches at Baker University, University of Phoenix, and large-scale leaks affecting Condé Nast and Wired.com, collectively exposing tens of millions of records. The cryptocurrency sector suffered persistent threats, with Trust Wallet's browser extension compromise draining over $7 million, and sector-wide losses exceeding $3.35 billion for the year. Sophisticated malware campaigns, supply chain attacks, and phishing operations—often exploiting trusted platforms and third-party software—underscore the increasing complexity and scale of adversary tactics. The prevalence of exploits targeting enterprise software and browser extensions highlights the urgent need for patch management and vendor risk oversight.",
    "trends": "The past seven days reveal several critical trends: (1) Supply chain and third-party vendor breaches are escalating, as seen in the Trust Wallet, banking, and media sector incidents. (2) Attackers are increasingly leveraging browser extensions, npm packages, and fake PoCs to deliver malware and conduct phishing campaigns, targeting both technical and non-technical users. (3) Ransomware, credential theft, and data exfiltration remain dominant, with financial, educational, and healthcare organizations disproportionately affected. (4) There is a noticeable spike in large-scale data leaks—often claimed by organized threat groups—accompanied by ransom demands or public dumps. (5) Cryptocurrency platforms and users face persistent, multi-vector threats, with attackers exploiting vulnerabilities and social engineering at scale.",
    "predictions": "Over the coming days, expect continued high-severity breaches, particularly targeting financial services, crypto platforms, and enterprises with weak supply chain defenses. Threat actors will likely intensify attacks leveraging browser extensions, third-party authentication vulnerabilities, and phishing campaigns via popular package repositories. Media and gaming companies should remain alert for extortion attempts and unverified breach claims. Supply chain and vendor risk will remain a top concern, with a strong likelihood of further incidents involving trusted platforms. Organizations should prioritize rapid patching, enhanced monitoring, and verification of vendor and extension updates. Overall, confidence in these predictions is high (>80%), given the sustained attacker activity and evolving tactics observed this week."
