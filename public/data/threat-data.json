  "past7Days": {
    "briefing": "This week witnessed a sustained escalation in cyber threats, with multiple high-severity incidents impacting both enterprises and individuals across the globe. The most disruptive events included widespread exploitation of critical vulnerabilities in React Server Components (CVE-2025-55182), Fortinet products, and newly disclosed flaws in key platforms such as n8n, iMessage, and Dropbear. The financial sector was heavily targeted, highlighted by a $50 million USDT address-poisoning scam and significant breaches at Ribbon Finance and Yearn Finance. Ransomware and infostealer campaigns (e.g., Clop at University of Phoenix, Stealka malware, RatOn NFC fraud) demonstrated increasing sophistication and reach, while coordinated phishing and fraud operations affected government, education, and manufacturing sectors. Notably, law enforcement made impactful interventions against large-scale fraud, but the overall threat landscape remains volatile, with cybercriminals exploiting both technical and social attack vectors.",
    "trends": "Key trends include a surge in exploits targeting web application frameworks (React, n8n), persistent weaponization of zero-day vulnerabilities, and rapid deployment of ransomware following initial access. Scams and credential theft—especially via address poisoning in crypto and phishing campaigns—are at all-time highs, with major losses reported. Malware distribution is increasingly leveraging trusted platforms such as GitHub and game mods, broadening the reach to non-traditional targets like gamers and university staff. Data breaches affecting millions (700Credit, University of Phoenix, Baker University, French Ministry of the Interior) indicate an uptick in attacks on large data repositories. Sectors seeing increased targeting include government, manufacturing, finance, and education, with multi-stage campaigns mixing technical exploits and social engineering.",
    "predictions": "In the upcoming days, expect continued active exploitation of recently disclosed vulnerabilities (React2Shell, n8n, Dropbear, iMessage), likely resulting in further ransomware and data breach incidents. The crypto sector remains highly vulnerable to sophisticated scams and wallet-draining malware, with high confidence in ongoing address-poisoning and phishing attacks. New infostealers and RATs (e.g., Stealka, RatOn) are likely to proliferate via fake mods and pirated software, targeting both individuals and organizations. Large-scale data breaches and credential theft will continue, particularly targeting sectors with high-value data (finance, education, government). Organizations should prioritize immediate patching, multi-factor authentication, and user awareness programs. Confidence level: High for technical exploit/ransomware activity, Medium-High for social engineering and financial fraud campaigns."
