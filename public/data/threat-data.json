  "past7Days": {
    "briefing": "The past week has been marked by a series of high-impact cyber incidents concentrated in the finance, crypto, academic, and infrastructure sectors. Notable breaches include major financial institutions (SitusAMC, Bank Mandiri), academic organizations (Harvard, Dartmouth), and prominent cryptocurrency exchanges (Upbit, Yearn Finance). The cumulative effect of these events has resulted in substantial financial losses, widespread data exposure, and increased risk for both organizations and individual users. The persistence and sophistication of attacks—from multi-year data leaks to advanced exploits and coordinated scams—underscore a rapidly evolving threat landscape that demands immediate attention at executive and operational levels.",
    "trends": "The week exhibited a sustained spike in high-severity events, particularly targeting financial services and crypto platforms. Ransomware/extortion gangs (e.g., Clop) remain active, while exploits against collaboration tools (Microsoft Teams) and wallet vulnerabilities highlight the diversification of attack vectors. Scam and phishing campaigns are pervasive, affecting individuals' pensions, trading accounts, and even sports organizations. There is a noticeable clustering of large-scale hacks (Upbit, Yearn Finance) toward the end of the week, and aggregate crypto losses for November reached $127M. Data leaks impacting critical infrastructure, government, healthcare, and aerospace indicate an ongoing risk to essential services.",
    "predictions": "For the upcoming days, expect continued targeting of financial institutions, crypto platforms, and large enterprises, with possible spillover into operational technology and critical infrastructure. There is a high likelihood of further exploits and wallet attacks in the crypto space, and ransomware/extortion activity may intensify, especially as threat actors seek to capitalize on recent successes. Scams and phishing will remain prevalent, potentially expanding into holiday-themed lures. Categories to watch: crypto hacks, financial data breaches, infrastructure leaks, and social engineering scams. Confidence Level: High—based on event volume, severity, and global threat actor activity. Organizations should prioritize incident response, patch management, and user awareness to mitigate emerging risks."
