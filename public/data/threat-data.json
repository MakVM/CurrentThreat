    "briefing": "This week marked a surge in high-severity cyber incidents affecting financial institutions, crypto platforms, digital media, and service providers worldwide. Notable attacks included major breaches at Trust Wallet, significant data leaks impacting Condé Nast and ENSAI, ransomware and supply chain exploits targeting Omrania and Atalian, and an ongoing campaign draining wallets across EVM chains. The rapid emergence of new attack automation tools (ErrTraffic), sophisticated phishing operations, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in browser extensions and server frameworks underscored the expanding threat landscape. Financial losses, large-scale data exposure, and persistent attacks on critical infrastructure and DeFi protocols highlight the urgent need for improved defense, third-party risk management, and user awareness.",
    "trends": "Multiple days saw spikes in high-severity breaches and data leaks, particularly in the crypto and financial sectors, with Trust Wallet and Unleash Protocol repeatedly in headlines. Large-scale exfiltration of sensitive data from digital media (Condé Nast, WIRED), education (ENSAI), and service firms (Atalian, Omrania) shows adversaries targeting institutions rich in personal and financial information. There is a clear uptick in supply chain and third-party vendor attacks, along with increased automation of attack delivery (ErrTraffic) and evolving phishing tactics (Silver Fox, npm packages). The latter part of the week saw more credential theft, botnet activity, and exploitation of emerging vulnerabilities (React2Shell, AWS key flaw), indicating threat actors are diversifying methods and targets. Financial, DeFi, and support platforms (Binance) remain under sustained pressure.",
    "predictions": "In the coming days, expect continued high threat levels against crypto wallets, DeFi platforms, and financial institutions, with supply chain vulnerabilities and third-party risks persisting as major attack vectors. Data leaks, ransomware, and credential theft will likely remain prominent, especially as attackers exploit new automation tools and unpatched vulnerabilities in web and server frameworks. The proliferation of phishing campaigns targeting specific regions (e.g., India) and sectors (industrial, healthcare) is set to continue. Organizations handling large user databases and financial transactions should anticipate increased targeting, and prioritize rapid patching, third-party risk assessment, and user education. Confidence in these predictions is high, given the sustained activity and diversification of tactics observed across sectors and geographies."
