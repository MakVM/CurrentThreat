  "past7Days": {
    "briefing": "Over the past week, the cyber threat landscape remained highly active and diverse, with multiple high-severity incidents affecting critical sectors such as finance, cryptocurrency, sports, education, and software supply chains. Notable events included major breaches at the French Football Federation, a banking software vendor, and the University of Pennsylvania, along with targeted attacks on crypto platforms Upbit, Yearn Finance, and Goldfinch Finance resulting in multimillion-dollar losses. Software supply chain risks surged with the Shai-Hulud NPM attack and the distribution of Babylon RAT via a popular utility. Social engineering and scam attempts persisted, often targeting users through impersonation and fake interviews. Although some days were quiet, the overall week spotlighted persistent vulnerabilities, aggressive exploitation, and a need for strengthened cyber resilience.",
    "trends": "Several key trends emerged: (1) Targeted financial sector attacks—especially on crypto exchanges and banking software vendors—remain prevalent, with both technical exploits and social engineering reported. (2) Supply chain compromises are a growing concern, highlighted by trojanized software and widespread NPM package infections, resulting in credential leaks and downstream risks. (3) Data breaches affecting public institutions and retail sectors are on the rise, with ransomware groups and persistent threat actors claiming responsibility. (4) Scam activity is continuous, but mostly low severity, with increased user awareness and reporting. (5) Sophisticated surveillance tech leaks (e.g., Intellexa) signal ongoing espionage and privacy threats, while large-scale financial losses in crypto—$127 million in November alone—underscore sector volatility.",
    "predictions": "For the upcoming days, expect continued elevated risk in the financial and crypto sectors, with likely attempts at exploiting wallet flaws, DeFi vulnerabilities, and institutional data stores. Software supply chain attacks may accelerate, targeting open-source repositories and widely used utilities—organizations should prioritize patching and integrity checks. Social engineering and scam campaigns will persist, likely using emerging trends and impersonation tactics, especially around high-profile events and entities. Surveillance tech leaks and government-focused breaches could gain media attention, driving regulatory scrutiny. Confidence level: High—based on sustained threat actor activity, sector volatility, and recent incident volume. Organizations in finance, crypto, retail, and public sectors should remain on heightened alert, reinforce user education, and enhance monitoring for supply chain and credential-based attacks."
