      "description": "Yearn Finance suffered an exploit in its yETH stable swap pool on November 30, 2025, at 21:11 UTC. The attacker exploited a vulnerability to mint approximately 235 trillion yETH tokens, leading to the draining of liquidity pools on Balancer and total losses of around $9 million. Of this, $3 million (1000 ETH) was sent to Tornado Cash, with the remaining $6 million held by the attacker. A detailed report on the exploit is available.",

    "briefing": "This week saw a surge in high-impact cyber incidents across the financial, cryptocurrency, and critical infrastructure sectors. Key events included major data breaches at Dartmouth College, Bank Mandiri, and the French Football Federation, alongside significant hacks in the crypto space such as the Upbit Solana exploit and the Yearn Finance yETH pool attack. The cumulative financial losses from these attacks in November alone reached $127 million, highlighting the increasing sophistication and frequency of threats. Scam and phishing activity remained persistent, targeting both individuals and organizations, while vulnerabilities in mainstream platforms like Microsoft Teams and DeFi protocols introduced additional risks. Overall, the week was characterized by elevated threat levels, underscoring the urgent need for robust incident response and proactive security measures.",
    "trends": "The dominant trend is a sustained spike in financially motivated attacks targeting both traditional financial institutions and crypto platforms, with a notable concentration of large-scale exploits and data breaches. DeFi protocols, exchanges, and fintech services faced repeated hacks and wallet vulnerabilities, while scam and phishing incidents continued to proliferate, particularly via social channels like Telegram and Reddit. High-severity events occurred almost daily, with a brief lull on November 30th, suggesting attackers are increasingly opportunistic and persistent. Data leaks affecting critical infrastructure and government entities also signal a broader scope of targeting. The use of Tornado Cash and other obfuscation tools in crypto exploits points to advanced laundering tactics.",
    "predictions": "For the upcoming days, expect continued targeting of crypto exchanges, DeFi platforms, and financial institutions, with a strong likelihood of further exploits and data breaches. Newly disclosed vulnerabilities, such as those in Microsoft Teams and wallet infrastructures, may be leveraged by attackers, so organizations should prioritize patching and monitoring. Scam and phishing activity will remain high, especially around platforms with large user bases and weak verification controls. Surveillance of social engineering tactics and fraud reports should be intensified. Confidence level for these predictions is high, given the volume, severity, and diversity of incidents observed this week. Critical infrastructure and government entities should also brace for more sophisticated data leaks and extortion attempts as threat actors diversify their targets."
