  "past7Days": {
    "briefing": "The week of November 19–25, 2025, was marked by an elevated cyber threat environment, with a series of high-severity breaches, ransomware attacks, and exploits targeting major corporations, government entities, fintech platforms, and academic institutions. Notable incidents included major data breaches at AT&T, Salesforce, Beckett Collectibles, NAFFCO INC, C&M Software, and SitusAMC—with the latter impacting top-tier financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi. Critical infrastructure risks were amplified by active zero-day exploits against Chrome and Oracle E-Business Suite, while insider threats and phishing campaigns further expanded the attack surface. The Cl0p and DragonForce hacking groups were especially prominent, showcasing the continued evolution and aggressiveness of organized cybercrime. The week demonstrated that attackers are leveraging both technical vulnerabilities and social engineering, with substantial financial, reputational, and privacy impacts across sectors.",
    "trends": "There is a clear surge in large-scale data breaches, ransomware, and supply chain attacks, with threat actors increasingly targeting third-party vendors and service providers (e.g., Gainsight, SitusAMC). Zero-day and novel exploit activity remains high, particularly in widely used platforms like Chrome, Oracle, and Microsoft OS. Cryptocurrency-related exploits and laundering tactics (e.g., GANA Payment, Coinbase) are persistent, mirroring broader financial fraud trends. Insider threats and social engineering attacks—including phishing and voice scams—are on the rise, impacting even security-focused organizations like CrowdStrike and prominent academic institutions. The overall threat scores remain consistently elevated throughout the week, signaling sustained attacker activity and expanding risk profiles.",
    "predictions": "Expect continued targeting of financial institutions and their vendors, with high risk of additional supply chain and third-party data breaches. Vulnerabilities in enterprise software (Oracle, Microsoft, SAP) will likely be exploited further, especially by organized groups like Cl0p and LAPSUS$, so rapid patching and monitoring are essential. Cryptocurrency platforms, payment processors, and fintech providers will remain attractive targets for both technical exploits and fraud. Increased phishing and scam activity against consumer and academic sectors is probable, alongside ongoing ransomware and insider threat risks. Confidence in these predictions is high (80–90%), given the persistent patterns and recent escalation in attack sophistication and frequency. Organizations should prioritize incident response readiness, vendor risk management, and user awareness training over the upcoming days."
