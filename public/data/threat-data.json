    "briefing": "This week was marked by a pronounced surge in high-severity cyberattacks, with a particular focus on large-scale data breaches, exploits targeting crypto wallets and financial institutions, and sophisticated phishing operations. Major incidents included breaches impacting millions of records in media, education, and e-commerce sectors; targeted ransomware and botnet campaigns; and evolving threats against DeFi protocols and wallet infrastructures. Notably, coordinated attacks on EVM-compatible wallets and Android banking users resulted in significant financial losses, while the continued exploitation of historical breaches (e.g., LastPass) underscored the persistent nature of credential theft. Organizations across critical infrastructure, financial services, and technology remain at heightened risk, with threat actors demonstrating increased sophistication and adaptability.",
    "trends": "Several clear trends emerged: 1) A spike in financially motivated attacks, especially targeting crypto wallets (Trust Wallet, MetaMask, multi-chain exploits) and global banking apps (Android malware). 2) Data breaches and leaks affected a wide range of sectors, with attackers exfiltrating massive datasets (Condé Nast, ENSAI, OfferteCartucce) and leveraging exposed credentials for further exploitation. 3) Attackers are rapidly adopting new tools and vulnerabilities, such as ErrTraffic and React2Shell, to automate and scale malware delivery, particularly against server infrastructure (Next.js). 4) Phishing remains a dominant attack vector, with campaigns growing more targeted and leveraging holiday-themed lures. The persistence of botnets and the reactivation of old breach data (LastPass) for new thefts highlight a cycle of ongoing risk.",
    "predictions": "Expect continued high-risk activity in the coming days, particularly in crypto and financial services. Multi-chain wallet draining exploits and phishing campaigns are likely to persist or escalate, with attackers targeting users during seasonal periods of high online activity. Vulnerabilities in web infrastructure (Next.js, npm packages) and the rise of automated attack tools suggest further exploitation attempts against tech and cloud service providers. Data breaches will remain frequent, with attackers seeking to monetize leaked credentials and personal information. The risk of credential theft linked to historical breaches will continue, especially as threat actors recycle old data for new campaigns. Overall, confidence in these predictions is high given the volume and sophistication of recent events, with finance, tech, and critical infrastructure sectors advised to operate at elevated alert levels and prioritize rapid incident response and user education."
